Submission for HTML/CSS/JS SBA
<br>The basic site layout and design for the Twitch chatbot in preparation for my case study project.

The navigation bar is fixed and present on all pages.
<br>It features the logo which takes you to the home page, navigation (duh), and a "Login with Twitch" button.
<br>Most pages also feature a footer with external links.

Not all pages will be visible without linking your Twitch account (once I get that sorted).
<br>Sites always visible will be marked with :earth_americas:
<br>Sites requiring login will be marked with :lock:

- Index :earth_americas:
  - The Welcome/Home page showing off the features of the site and bot. 
- Dashboard :earth_americas:
  - A dashboard to display statistics and info from the connected Twitch channel.
- Chat :lock:
  - Currently just an embedded version of chat found on Twitch.
  - Offers the same full functionality outside of sending messages.
  - Try chatting on [my test channel](https://www.twitch.tv/vendydev) to see the results back on this page (requires Twitch login).
- Commands :lock:
  - This table is where users will be able 
- Guide :earth_americas:
  - Essentially the placeholder until I get the actual functionality of the site sorted.
  - Has a button that links back to here lol.
- About :earth_americas:
  - A small summary about the site, bot, and project.
  - Includes a "Thank You" section for people and resources of help and support.
  - Also features the external links to various related sites.

Thanks for reading
<br>I hope you enjoy your look around!
